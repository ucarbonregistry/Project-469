NSL Sugars Limited (NSL), is one of the most efficient sugar companies in south India and a sugar 
arm of ‘NSL Group’. NSL Group entered the ‘sugar’ business being related to agro-commercial crop 
business. NSL Krishnaveni Sugars Ltd is a green field sugar plant established in 2011 with a capacity
of 3500 TCD along with 28.2 MW cogen plant. Both Sugar & Cogen Plant operations are commenced 
in February 2011. This particular project is owned by M/s NSL KRISHNAVENI SUGARS LTD (also 
hereinafter referred to as NSL KSL) and hereby to be called as Project Proponent.
NSL Sugars plant has been working with the state of art equipment for sugar to achieve 3500 MT/day 
crushing and 28.2 MW bagasse based co-gen power plant since commissioning in 01/02/2011.
The current project activity included under this UCR document is located in Ramakrishnapur Village, 
Kothakota Mandal in the district of Mahbubnagar in Telangana state of India. 

The main scopes are:
Scope 1: Generation of carbon credits due to an existing 28.2 MW bagasse-based cogeneration unit at Ramakrishnapur sugar mill.
Scope 2: Generation of carbon credits due to production and applicability of bioethanol 
produced in the unit which is supplied to OMCs for blending with petrol or equivalent 
services.

Both these scopes are well recognized activity under GHG mechanisms due to the reduction of carbon 
emissions as compared to their respective baseline scenarios viz. displacement of grid electricity with 
the export power produced & supplied from the co-generation unit and displacement of petrol with a 
share of blending of bioethanol supplied by NSL. 
The Co-generation Unit:
The purpose of the project activity is to utilize available mill generated bagasse effectively for 
generation of steam and electricity for both in-house consumption and to export surplus electricity to 
the power grid. The project meets the captive steam and power requirement of sugar unit, cogeneration (Cogen) plant auxiliaries and power requirement of the facilities. The balance power is exported to Indian Grid.

As per design specification, the unit has an existing co-generation unit with installed capacity of 28.2
MW turbine, out of which 2% of gross electricity generated is assumed to be imported electricity. 
During the off season the plant generates 25.5 MW of power with 2.7 MW of captive consumption 
load and during the season the plant generates 16 MW of power with 5.5 MW of captive consumption 
load. PLF for the plant during off season is 90.43% and during the season it is 73.56% and the plant 
is operational since commissioning on 01/02/2011.

The major equipment of the project activity comprises 110 Tons Per Hour (TPH) capacity steam 
generator with the outlet steam parameters of 110 atm and 540oC, 28.2 MW BHEL make double 
extraction cum condensing Turbine. 

Plant operates for 365 days per annum approximately, which includes 150 days of crushing season, 
and 215 days of off-season. The plant is designed with all other auxiliary plant systems like bagasse 
/ biomass handling system with storage and processing arrangements, ash handling system, water 
treatment plant, cooling water system and cooling tower, De-Mineralized (DM) water plant, 
compressed air system and balance of plant including high pressure piping etc. for its successful 
operation. The provision of extraction cum condensing machine allows the possibility of operating 
the plant during the off-season with the saved bagasse and procured surplus biomass residues.

The Bioethanol Unit:
The purpose of bioethanol plant is to produce ethanol for blending with regular fuel as substitute. 
Bioethanol fuel is mainly produced by the sugar fermentation process, although it can also be 
manufactured by the chemical process of reacting ethylene with steam. Ethanol can be produced from 
biomass by the hydrolysis and sugar fermentation processes. Biomass wastes contain a complex 
mixture of carbohydrate polymers from the plant cell walls known as cellulose, hemi cellulose and 
lignin. In order to produce sugars from the biomass, the biomass is pre-treated with acids or enzymes 
in order to reduce the size of the feedstock and to open up the plant structure. Thus, bioethanol from 
sugar plan is the output of series process that goes through Fermentation, Distillation and Molecular 
Sieve Dehydration (MSDH) process. 

The project activity was commissioned on 01/11/2012 and bioethanol is being produced for producing 
blended biofuel by OMCs to whom NSL has supply contracts. This blended biofuel is finally used as 
fuel in existing stationary installations (e.g. diesel generators) and/or in vehicles within India. The 
project activity is hence a renewable energy project activity that displaces more-GHG-intensive fossil 
fuel for combustion in vehicles and stationary installations.

The key features of the bioethanol project scope are as follows:
Existing installed capacity : 120 KLPD
Purpose : To supply for biofuel blending by Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs)
Blending types : B10 and B20.
The energy values : 44.22 MJ/kg with a blend of 10% (E10)
The targeted blending : Current-12-13%, however, as per central government order to be 
achieved 25% blending by year of 2025.

NSL Sugars Limited (NSL), project activity has implemented the combination of two scopes (power 
& bioethanol) which are well recognized activities under GHG mechanisms due to the reduction of 
carbon emissions as compared to the baseline scenarios viz. displacement of grid electricity with the 
export power produced & supplied from the co-generation unit. Thus, NSL Sugars Limited (NSL), 
project activity scopes helps to contribute to emission reductions as well as SDG targets creating a 
sustainable pathway.
